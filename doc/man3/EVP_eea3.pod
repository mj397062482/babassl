=head1 NAME

EVP_eea3
- EVP 128-EEA3 stream cipher

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_eea3(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The 3GPP 128-EEA3 stream cipher for EVP.

The 128-EEA3 is a stream cipher that is used to encrypt or decrypt blocks of data
using a confidentiality key. The block of data may be between 1 and 2 ^ 32 bits
long. The 128-EEA3 algorithm uses ZUC as a keystream generator.

3GPP TS 35.221 is the specification for 128-EEA3 and TS 35.222 is the specification
for ZUC algorithm.

Both 128-EEA3 and ZUC algorithms are standardized first as Chinese national
cryptographic standards - the GM/T 0001-2012 series.

=item EVP_eea3()

The 128-EEA3 stream cipher with a 128-bit key based on the ZUC keystream
generation algorithm.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

This function returns a B<EVP_CIPHER> structure that contains the
implementation of the symmetric cipher. See L<EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3)> for
details of the B<EVP_CIPHER> structure.
